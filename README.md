# OLEDBlackScreen
Screen saver kind app to save OLED screen (Which blocks ScreenSaver)

Idea is to have sleep and screensaver blocking "Screen saver". Currently in a stage, that I just wrote the thougts down.

### Usage:
  - Hide: **Esc**-key
  - Shut Down/Close: **Alt+F**, **Ctrl+X** and **Ctrl+C**
  - [Rest of the stuff into here]
