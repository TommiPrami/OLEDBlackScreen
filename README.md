# OLEDBlackScreen
Screen saver kind app to save OLED screen (Which blocks ScreenSaver)

[## Work heavily in progress]

Idea is to have sleep and screensaver blocking "Screen saver". 

Starts as minimized to tray. (So if you start this, it seems that nothing happens, might change later)

### Usage:
  - Hide: **Esc**-key
  - Shut Down/Close: **Alt+F4**, **Ctrl+X** and **Ctrl+C**
  - Right click to the tray icon for menu (for settings etc)

### TODO:
- ~~Make installer, needs tweaking~~
- ~~Add pause-functionality~~
- ~~trayincon menu~~
- ~~most likely right click menu~~
- ~~Fix Tray Incon (Showns only black)~~
- ~~Some kind of settinsg screen~~
  - ~~Saving and using settings~~
  - ~~configurable timeouts etc.~~
- ...
