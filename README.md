# OLEDBlackScreen
Screen saver kind app to save OLED screen (Which blocks ScreenSaver)

[## Work heavily in progress]

Idea is to have sleep and screensaver blocking "Screen saver". 

Starts as minimized to tray. (So if you start this, it seems that nothing happens, might change later)

### Usage:
  - Hide: **Esc**-key
  - Shut Down/Close: **Alt+F4**, **Ctrl+X** and **Ctrl+C**
  - [Rest of the stuff into here]
  - Double click to the tray icon will bring up settings screen (for now)

### TODO:

- trayincon menu
- most likely right click menu
- Fix Tray Incon (Showns only black)
- ~~Some kind of settinsg screen~~
  - ~~Saving and using settings~~
  - ~~configurable timeouts etc.~~
- ...
